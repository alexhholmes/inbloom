# InBloom

A Rust implementation of the HyperLogLog algorithm. This is used to estimate the cardinality of a multiset, or in other 
words, estimate the number of distinct elements in a multiset. The implementation is inspired by 
[cloudflare/trie-hard](https://github.com/cloudflare/trie-hard).

Based on the research paper _HyperLogLog: the analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm_ by
Philippe Flajolet, Éric Fusy, Olivier Gandouet, and Frédéric Meunier.

Additionally, the following papers are referenced:
- _Loglog Counting of Large Cardinalities (Extended Abstract)_
- _HyperLogLog in Practice: Algorithmic Engineering of a State of The Art Cardinality Estimation Algorithm_
- _LogLog-Beta and More: A New Algorithm for Cardinality Estimation Based on LogLog Counting_
